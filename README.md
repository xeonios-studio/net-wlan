Short description of the WiFi bruteforce app.

Overview:

Our WiFi bruteforce app is a powerful tool designed to test the security of your WiFi networks. The app allows you to systematically test different passwords to ensure your network is protected against unauthorized access. Main functions:

    Network scan: The app scans available WiFi networks in your area and displays them in a clear ListView.
    Password bruteforce: The app systematically generates passwords and attempts to connect to the selected networks.
    Adjust password length: You can set the length of the passwords to be tested using a ComboBox (e.g. 16 or 20 characters).
    Avoiding duplicates: The app stores tested passwords in a file to ensure that no duplicate keys are tested.
    Result logging: Every connection attempt is logged and displayed in the console so you can monitor progress.

User interface:

    ListView: Displays available WiFi networks including SSID, MAC address (BSSID), signal quality, security status and network type.
    TextBox: Displays the currently tested password.
    ComboBox: Allows you to select the length of passwords to test.
    Buttons: Start and stop the bruteforce process and perform manual network scans.

Use:

    Network Scan: Click the scan button to find available WiFi networks.
    Select password length: Select the desired password length in the ComboBox.
    Start bruteforce: Click on the bruteforce button to start the bruteforce process. The app generates passwords and attempts to connect to the selected networks.
    Monitor results: Monitor the results in the console and in the TextBox that displays the currently tested password.

Safety notice:
This app is intended solely for security audits and authorized use on your own networks. Unauthorized access to third-party networks is illegal and punishable by law.
